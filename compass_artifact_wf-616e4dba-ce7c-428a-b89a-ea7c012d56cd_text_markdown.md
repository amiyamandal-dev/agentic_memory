# Databricks Online Tables Migration Strategy
## Executive Summary & Technical Implementation Guide

### Critical Business Impact
**Databricks has mandated the deprecation of legacy online tables with a hard deadline of January, 2026.** After this date, all legacy online table functionality will be permanently disabled, making migration to modern alternatives mandatory for business continuity. Organizations currently relying on online tables for real-time ML inference or operational applications must complete migration to avoid service disruption.

This transformation represents both a compliance requirement and a strategic modernization opportunity. The migration enables access to Unity Catalog governance, serverless scaling, improved performance characteristics, and enhanced security controls while aligning with Databricks' unified lakehouse architecture vision.

### Executive Decision Framework
Organizations face two primary migration paths, each optimized for distinct use cases:

- **Databricks Online Feature Store**: ML-native solution for feature serving with automatic governance
- **Lakehouse Synced Tables**: General-purpose OLTP solution with PostgreSQL compatibility

The selection criteria center on workload characteristics, team capabilities, and long-term architectural strategy rather than simple technical preferences.

## 1. Understanding the Architectural Transformation

### Current State Analysis
**Legacy online tables were designed as single-purpose ML serving infrastructure** with significant architectural limitations that no longer align with modern data platform requirements:

- **Storage constraints**: Large storage limitations per metastore with proprietary row-oriented format
- **Performance bottlenecks**: Limited throughput capacity with restricted concurrent access
- **Governance gaps**: No Unity Catalog integration, limited lineage tracking, and manual security management
- **Operational overhead**: Custom storage format requiring specialized maintenance and monitoring
- **Cost inefficiency**: Storage overhead significantly larger than compressed Delta tables

### Target State Architecture
Both migration options leverage **Lakebase**, Databricks' new PostgreSQL-compatible database engine that provides:

- **Unified governance** through Unity Catalog integration with fine-grained access controls
- **Serverless scaling** with separated compute and storage for cost optimization
- **Sub-millisecond query latency** with support for thousands of concurrent queries per second
- **ACID transaction support** with full consistency guarantees
- **Enhanced security** including encryption at rest, in transit, and network isolation
- **Comprehensive monitoring** with built-in observability and alerting capabilities

### Key Technical Differences

| Aspect | Legacy Online Tables | Online Feature Store | Synced Tables |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| **Storage Format** | Proprietary row-oriented | Delta Lake with Unity Catalog | PostgreSQL with Delta sync |
| **Governance** | Manual security management | Automatic Unity Catalog integration | Unity Catalog + PostgreSQL RBAC |
| **Performance** | Limited throughput capacity | Sub-millisecond with auto-scaling | Sub-millisecond with high QPS |
| **Query Capabilities** | Key-value lookup only | ML-optimized feature retrieval | Full SQL with complex joins |
| **Ecosystem Integration** | Limited API access | Native MLflow/Mosaic AI | Standard PostgreSQL ecosystem |
| **Operational Model** | Custom infrastructure | Serverless managed service | Managed PostgreSQL instances |
